# Chrome extension: inRiver Workarea Zoom

To install, download the source folder on your local drive. Then, add the extension to Chrome [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/):
1. Activate the developer mode checkbox.
2. Load the unpacked extension from the source folder. 

The extension needs to stay in the folder. It will stop working if it's moved or deleted.

After installing the extension, you will have a new button in your Chrome toolbar. Click on it and use the slider to choose the zoom for the entity cards.

Note that the extension could stop working after an update if inRiver makes modifications that change the HTML markup of the workarea page.

Keep in mind that if you have very large images, this can make the Enrich app less responsive.
